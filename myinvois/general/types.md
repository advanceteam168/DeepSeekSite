# Types

The section contains the definitions of the document structures that APIs can operate within the current version of the MyInvois System.  
The solution will support UBL 2.1 standards and would support both JSON and XML as described here [UBL-2.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html) and here [UBL-2.1-JSON-v2.0-cnd01](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1-JSON/v2.0/cnd01/UBL-2.1-JSON-v2.0-cnd01.html).
