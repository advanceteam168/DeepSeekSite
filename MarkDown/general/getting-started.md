# Getting Started with MyInvois System

This guide provides essential information about the MyInvois System and how to get started with integration.

## LHDNM MyInvois System Overview

To support the growth of the digital economy, the Government is implementing e-Invoice in stages to enhance Malaysia's tax administration management efficiency. This initiative aligns with the Twelfth Malaysia Plan, aiming to strengthen digital services infrastructure and modernize tax administration through digitalization.
